Bit manipulation is a fundamental technique used in computer programming to manipulate individual bits within a binary representation of data. In computers, data is represented using a sequence of bits (0s and 1s), and bit manipulation allows programmers to perform operations at the bit level to achieve specific goals efficiently.

The basic unit of information in binary representation is a bit, which can hold one of two values: 0 or 1. When multiple bits are combined, they form larger units of data, such as bytes, integers, or other data types. By manipulating these individual bits, programmers can perform various tasks, such as setting or clearing specific flags, extracting certain parts of data, or performing bitwise logical operations.
