Bit manipulation refers to the manipulation of individual bits or groups of bits within a binary representation of data. In computing, data is typically stored and processed in binary form, which consists of sequences of 0s and 1s. Bit manipulation allows programmers to perform various operations on these individual bits, such as setting or clearing specific bits, shifting them left or right, or extracting certain bits from a larger binary value.
