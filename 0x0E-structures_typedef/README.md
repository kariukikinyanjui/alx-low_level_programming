A structure is a user-defined data type that allows you to group together related variables of different types under a single name. It provides a way to create a composite data type that can hold multiple pieces of data, each with its own data type.

The typedef keyword in C is used to create aliases or alternative names for existing data types. It allows you to define custom names for data types, making your code more readable and easier to maintain.
