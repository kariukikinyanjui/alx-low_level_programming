malloc stands for "memory allocation" and is used to dynamically allocate memory during the execution of a program. It allows you to request a specific amount of memory from the operating system's heap. The function takes the number of bytes you want to allocate as an argument and returns a pointer to the start of the allocated memory block.

The free function deallocates the memory block previously allocated by malloc or related functions.
