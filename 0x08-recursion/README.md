Recursion refers to the process in which a function calls itself as a subroutine or repeatedly solves a problem by reducing it into smaller and simpler instances of the same problem.
Recursion is implemented using a combination of two key components: a base case and a recursive call.
A base case provides the termination condition for the recursion.
The recursive call is the step where the function calls itself, typically with a modified input.
