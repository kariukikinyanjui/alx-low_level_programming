C programming language is a high-level programming language that is widely used for system programming and developing portable applications. C was originally developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s as a low-level language to be used on Unix-based systems.

C is known for its efficiency, speed, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for developing operating systems, compilers, embedded systems, and other performance-critical software applications. It is a procedural language, which means that programs are written as a sequence of step-by-step instructions.

C programs consist of functions and variables, which can be used to manipulate data and perform calculations. C also provides a number of built-in data types, such as integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and arrays, as well as control structures like if statements, for loops, and while loops.

C is often considered a "low-level" language, meaning that it provides a high degree of control over system resources such as memory and hardware devices. This makes it well-suited for systems programming, where close control over system resources is necessary. However, this also makes C more difficult to learn and use than higher-level programming languages like Python or Java.
