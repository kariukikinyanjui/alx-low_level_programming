A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node is called the tail. The tail node points to null, indicating the end of the list.

Overall, singly linked lists are versatile data structures that provide flexibility, dynamic memory allocation, and efficient manipulation of data in various applications and algorithms.
