Dynamic libraries, often referred to as shared libraries, are an essential concept in software development and programming. They play a crucial role in modularizing code, improving code reuse, and optimizing memory usage in a computer system. Examples of dynamic libraries include the Windows DLLs (Dynamic Link Libraries) and the shared object files (.so files) commonly found in Unix-like systems.

In summary, dynamic libraries provide an efficient and modular approach to software development by enabling code sharing, modularity, and efficient memory usage. However, they also come with considerations such as dependency management and potential version conflicts.
