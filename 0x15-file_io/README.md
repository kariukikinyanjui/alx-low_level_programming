File I/O (Input/Output) refers to the process of reading from and writing to files on a computer's storage system. It allows programs to interact with external files, which can be text files, binary files, or even special types like images or videos. File I/O is an essential aspect of programming, as it enables data persistence, configuration storage, and communication with other software or users.

In most programming languages, you can perform file I/O operations using specific functions or methods provided by the language's standard library.
