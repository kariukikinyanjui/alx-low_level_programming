File I/O (Input/Output) refers to the process of reading from and writing to files in a computer system. It allows programs to interact with files, such as reading data from files or writing data to files. File I/O is a fundamental concept in programming and is used in various applications, including reading configuration files, storing and retrieving data, and processing files.

Here's a brief overview of the common file I/O operations:

Opening a File: To read from or write to a file, you need to open it first. The open function usually takes the file path and a mode parameter as arguments. The mode can be "r" for reading, "w" for writing (creates a new file or overwrites an existing one), "a" for appending (writes at the end of an existing file), or a combination of these modes.

Reading from a File: Once a file is opened for reading, you can use various methods provided by the file object to read its contents. For example, in Python, you can use the read() method to read the entire content or readline() to read one line at a time.

Writing to a File: When a file is opened for writing, you can use methods like write() or writelines() to write data into the file. The write() method allows you to write a string, while writelines() takes a list of strings and writes them to the file.

Closing a File: After you have finished reading from or writing to a file, it's important to close it using the close() method. Closing a file releases system resources and ensures that all the data is written properly.
