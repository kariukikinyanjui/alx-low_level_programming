malloc stands for "memory allocation" and is used to dynamically allocate memory during the execution of a program. It allows you to request a specific amount of memory from the operating system's heap. The function takes the number of bytes you want to allocate as an argument and returns a pointer to the start of the allocated memory block.

The free function deallocates the memory block previously allocated by malloc or related functions.
In C programming, the exit() function is used to terminate the program and return a value to the operating system. It is defined in the stdlib.h header file.

The exit() function takes an integer argument, which represents the exit status of the program. The exit status is typically used to indicate whether the program terminated successfully or encountered an error. By convention, a return value of 0 indicates successful termination, while non-zero values indicate various error conditions or abnormal terminations.
