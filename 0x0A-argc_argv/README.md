argc stands for "argument count" and represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself.

argv stands for "argument vector" and is an array of strings (or a pointer to an array of strings) that contains the actual command-line arguments. Each element of the array represents a separate argument, with argv[0] typically being the name of the program itself, and subsequent elements (argv[1], argv[2], and so on) representing the additional arguments.
