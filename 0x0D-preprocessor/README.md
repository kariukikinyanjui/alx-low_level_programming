A preprocessor is a program or set of tools that performs preprocessing tasks on source code before it is compiled or interpreted. The purpose of a preprocessor is to modify the source code or provide additional information to the compiler or interpreter, thereby influencing the compilation or interpretation process.

Macros are a way to define reusable code snippets that can be expanded inline during compilation or interpretation. They are typically used to perform text substitution or code generation, allowing developers to write more concise and maintainable code.
